## What the...?

I'm organizing a community hackathon for friends and friends of friends! The core ideas for this hackathon will be shamelessly stolen from the **game jam** world.

## Here's the deal

So, we have a few groud rules.

The event will be **100% online** (on [Discord](https://discord.gg/ujgf3sMP3t)). You will only be able to join as a team of **2 to 4 members** (if you don't have a team we might be able to pair you with someone else that doesn't have a team, so reach out on [Discord](https://discord.gg/ujgf3sMP3t)). Every team will pay a **sum of money** for **each participant**. **All the money** will go towards the **prize fund**. The winner **takes it all**.

Everyone gets the same **24 hours**. The event will start on a **saturday morning** and end on a **sunday morning** (exact dates will be decided and announced on [Discord](https://discord.gg/ujgf3sMP3t)).

You **can** bring **pre-made assets**. Both **hardware and software** project are allowed (**any kind** of software. ex: games, desktop apps, mobile apps, websites, firmwares, etc.).

## The theme

Here's where we'll take some inspiration from the **game jam** world. The theme will **not be overly specific** like in other hackathons. Instead, we will pick a vague theme that you can use as a starting point for your idea. Your project must be **centered around the theme** but you won't have any other limitation, so **go nuts**! Example of themes (these may or may not be used): **Night vs Day**, **2030**, **Running out of energy**.

We will create a list of 20/30 themes. You will up-vote and down-vote them! The theme for the event will be randomnly chosen from the top 5.

## The winner

There won't be a judge! You will **vote eachother**! You **can't vote for your own team** and only participants to the event can vote.

The voting will be split into 3 categories (**creativity**, **theme** and **wow factor**). Everyone will give some points for each category (0-5). The overall winner will be the project with the most points (sum).

After the 24 hours are over every team must have everything they worked on in a public GitHub repository. In the `README.md` will be the intro/description of the project. A video presentation linked in the document would be very helpful, but not a requirement. Every team gets 5 minutes to present their project in front of everybody, followed by 5-7 minutes of Q&A.

After the presentations, the voting window will be opened. You will have ~1 hour to evaluate other projects and vote.

## I want in

If you're interested (and/or have questions) please [join the discord server](https://discord.gg/ujgf3sMP3t). Here I will post all the updates and will most likely also host the event.
