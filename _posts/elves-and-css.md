**WARNING**: this entire blog post is a rant.

So, [Next.js Conf](https://nextjs.org/conf) 2024 just happened, and I'm so mad. What the f\*ck happened to the web? What have we done? How much complexity can we f\*cking stack on top of this shit platform, and why do we have to solve everything with Javascript (this is a different rant)? 

Is this component rendered on the server or is it on the client? Or both? Should I `'use server'` or `use client`? Or neither? What's the default behaviour of `fetch` again? Does it cache?

And now we have `'use cache'`?
